# ☕ Espresso Machine Investment Case Study

This project analyzes the financial viability of investing in a high-efficiency espresso machine for a small coffee business. Using corporate finance tools, we evaluate whether this £12,000 investment is justified over a 5-year horizon.

## 🎯 Objective

Determine whether a £12,000 espresso machine will result in sufficient operational savings and profitability using:
- Net Present Value (NPV)
- Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
- Payback Period
- Sensitivity Analysis

---

## 📊 Methodology

- **Annual Savings**: £3,200  
- **Maintenance Costs**: £200 (Year 1) → £400 (Year 5)  
- **Discount Rate**: 10%  
- **Forecast Period**: 5 Years

All calculations were performed using Excel and Python. Two key visualizations were created to summarize the investment analysis.
